// its runtime handshake reaches, so this gate can never disagree with the
// close-4002 refusal); this program supplies the Go side from the engine's
// public constants and the client side from the engine artifact's own
// wire-compatibility manifest (-manifest, required).
//
// Exit 0: the pairing is declared-compatible. Exit 1: a declared floor is
// violated — the pairing would refuse at first connect with close code 4002,
// so fail the build instead. Exit 2: usage error (a missing, unreadable,
// malformed, unknown-schema or value-less manifest). A MIS-declared floor is
// out of scope here; that is the engine conformance suite's contract.
