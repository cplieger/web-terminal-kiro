# Assert every module the served page loads was emitted non-empty. Canonical
# recipe, shared by the Dockerfile builder and scripts/dev-build.sh: a tsconfig
# outDir/rootDir change or a lib src-layout move otherwise yields a clean build
# whose page 404s at runtime.
#
# The vendor targets are DERIVED from static/index.html's own importmap (the same
# extraction tests/image-smoke.conf's smoke_verify() runs against the SERVED
# page), so adding an importmap entry cannot leave a build path unchecked. The
# emit list used to be hardcoded twice -- once here, once in dev-build.sh -- and
# a new entry could ship a page that 404s the module it just added. static/app.js
# is asserted separately: it is the <script type=module src>, not an importmap
# entry, and so is every module it imports by relative path.
#
# Usage: assert-emit.sh [index.html] [static-dir]
