# warn_legacy_tool_metadata(): tell the operator that tool metadata left at its
# pre-$TOOLS location is IGNORED, and touch nothing.
#
# The tool manifest moved from /config into /config/tools as a clean break, so an
# upgraded volume keeps three unread files at the old paths while the engine seeds
# a fresh manifest beside the tree. The engine cannot report that (from its side
# the volume looks fresh), which is the whole reason this notice exists — and the
# reason its behaviour is worth pinning is that the function it replaced DID move
# those files. The no-op assertion below is what stops that migration coming back
# by accident.
#
# Lint directives for this whole file, each against a stated guarantee rather than
# an assumption:
#   SC2015 - the assertion form `[ cond ] && ok "..." || no "..."` cannot mis-fire,
#     because lib.sh's ok/no return 0 unconditionally by design (see their comment).
#   SC2329 - the fatal stub below is invoked INDIRECTLY, by the extracted function
#     it shadows, which shellcheck cannot see. It must never be reached; that is
#     the assertion.
