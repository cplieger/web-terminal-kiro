# warn_if_not_root(): the boot-time report that this image is root-by-design.
#
# Unreachable from tests/image-smoke.sh, which runs the image the supported way
# (no `user:` line) and therefore only ever sees the silent branch. The branch
# under test is the one an operator reaches by adding `user: "1000:1000"` out of
# *arr habit, and its entire value is the WORDING: the run continues either way,
# so a test that only checked "did it warn" would pass against a message that
# names none of the four things about to break.
# Lint directives, each against a stated guarantee rather than an assumption:
#   SC2015 - the assertion form `[ cond ] && ok "..." || no "..."` cannot mis-fire,
#     because lib.sh's ok/no return 0 unconditionally by design.

# --- 2. a non-root run warns, and NEVER escalates -------------------------------
# Fatal here would be worse than the mistake it reports: `fatal` sleeps and exits,
# so the operator loses the shell they would use to remove the `user:` line. This is
# the assertion that keeps a future "harden the entrypoint" pass from flipping it.

# messages, and none of them mentions the compose line responsible. If the remedy
# is not in this string, the function has no reason to be in the boot path.

# --- 5. the warn names each consequence ----------------------------------------

# failures, and a rewrite that drops one silently makes that one unattributable
# again. ssh is first because it is the only one with no workaround.

# --- 6. the hint stays inside its logfmt field ---------------------------------
# The hint quotes an error message verbatim. logfmt closes a quoted field on the
# first unescaped double quote, so a literal one inside would truncate the field and
# hand the rest to a log parser as garbage keys. The file's own
# warn_skipped_apt_token rewrites quotes for this reason; this asserts the hint
# followed suit.

# --- 7. the check runs BEFORE the work it explains -----------------------------
# A report that lands after make_config_dir has already exited is a report nobody
# reads: /config is checked with a fatal, so the misleading message wins the race
# and this one never prints. Ordering is the feature, asserted on the real text
# because a healthy image never takes the branch.
