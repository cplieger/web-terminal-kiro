# Neither branch is reachable in a healthy image smoke: the remount succeeds only
# with CAP_SYS_ADMIN and fails only without it, so the image test sees exactly one
# of the two. The re-exec block matters most, because its failure mode is a
# container that cannot boot, on every start, in an image whose public compose
# example adds NO capability -- so its contract is "never fatal, whatever the
# environment", asserted here against the real text of entrypoint.sh.
#
# Lint directives, each against a stated guarantee:
#   SC2015 - `[ cond ] && ok || no` cannot mis-fire: lib.sh's ok/no return 0
#     unconditionally by design.
#   SC2016 - the entrypoint-text assertions must stay single-quoted (literal
#     text, "$0"/"$@" unexpanded).
#   SC2329 - the `mount` stubs below are invoked INDIRECTLY by the extracted
#     function, which shellcheck cannot see.
