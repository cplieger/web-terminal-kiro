# prune_superseded_kas_runtimes(): reclaim the ~240 MB agent-server runtime each

# This function is a root `rm -rf` against a path derived from the environment, so
# the redirect cases carry the weight: a symlinked store, an unset HOME, a version
# string that could widen the keep-pattern. It is also hygiene, never an integrity
# gate — it warns and continues rather than failing boot, because disk cleanup must
# not brick a container.
# Lint directives for this whole file, each against a stated guarantee rather than
# an assumption:
#   SC2015 - the assertion form `[ cond ] && ok "..." || no "..."` cannot mis-fire,
#     because lib.sh's ok/no return 0 unconditionally by design (see their comment).
#   SC2034 - the variables set below are the INPUTS to entrypoint.sh code that is
#     extracted and sourced at RUNTIME, so shellcheck cannot see the reads.

# --- 3. THE SECURITY CASE: a symlinked store must not redirect a root rm -rf ----
#
# The victim tree's contents are DELIBERATELY version-keyed and non-pinned
# ("2.13.0-victim"), i.e. exactly the shape the pruner deletes. An earlier version
# of this test planted a directory named "precious", which the pruner skips anyway
# because it is not version-keyed -- so the assertion passed even with every
# symlink guard removed, and proved nothing. A guard test has to plant bait the
# unguarded code would actually take.
#
# Bait has to satisfy the EARLIER guards too, which the data-dir case got wrong for
# longer: the pruner returns at `[ -d "$kas_dir" ]` before it looks at any symlink,
# so a victim with no `kas` child was never reached and that case also passed with
# every guard removed. Each case below plants the version-keyed entries at the
# exact path the resolved $kas_dir names.

# Survival alone cannot say WHICH guard refused, and for this threat the two are
# redundant: realpath resolves a symlink away, so every redirect the -L check
# catches ALSO fails the containment check. No input isolates -L by outcome, and
# removing it on its own left this file 10/10 green. What the guards do not share is
# what they SAY, so each case asserts its own refusal line; drop the -L check and
# the symlink cases report the containment refusal instead, and fail here.
