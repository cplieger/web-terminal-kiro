# Shared harness for a repo's shell unit tests. A repo enrolls by committing a
# tests/shell/run.sh, which is also what the shell-ci hook looks for.
#
# WHY THESE SUITES EXIST, generically: an image smoke test proves the assembled
# image boots, so it can only ever walk the paths a HEALTHY container takes. The
# branches that matter most are the ones that fail CLOSED — a refusal, a guard, a
# fallback — and a healthy image never reaches them. These suites assert what
# happens when it should NOT work. Each repo's own rationale (which of its shell
# files are covered, and what its existing tests already own) belongs in its
# repo-owned tests/shell/run.sh header, not here.
#
# HOW: each test EXTRACTS one function verbatim out of the shipped shell and runs
# it against temp directories, stubbing only what spawns a process or touches the
# host. Nothing is reimplemented — an assertion against a paraphrase proves nothing
# about what ships. That requires the function under test to take its inputs as
# arguments or environment rather than hardcoding paths; where it does not, the
# honest answer is to leave it uncovered rather than to restructure shipped
# behaviour for the test's benefit.
#
# Sourced by every tests/shell/*_test.sh via the runner; not executable itself.

# The repo root, derived from this file's own location so a test behaves the same
# whether the runner, CI, or a developer in another directory invokes it.

# Overridable so a test can be pointed at an older revision of the file (the
# red-check a maintainer runs when adding a case: extract the previous
# entrypoint.sh to /tmp and confirm the new assertion actually fails against it).
#
# Deliberately NOT readonly, and reassignable mid-file: a repo whose shipped shell
# spans several files (an entrypoint plus sourced helpers) points ENTRYPOINT at each
# one in turn before extracting from it. Every extract validates the current value,
# so a stale or mistyped path names itself instead of surfacing as an empty
# extraction.

# One EXIT trap owns both end-of-process duties: scrub the scratch dir, and
# refuse to let a test file end without calling report. ok/no record failures but
# deliberately return 0 (see below), so a file whose final `report` line was lost
# would otherwise exit 0 after its last assertion and the runner would count a
# clean pass — a complete false green from a one-line deletion.
#
# The PID guard is load-bearing, not defensive: only the process that INSTALLED the
# trap may act on it. Without it, a child that reaches this handler runs it with the
# parent's $WORK and _reported=0 — printing a spurious forgot-report error and
# `rm -rf`-ing the parent's live scratch dir mid-run. Measured on the radvd latch
# suite before the guard: the error fired on 26 of 30 cases and a canary in $WORK
# was deleted on the first iteration.
#
# That symptom is real; the MECHANISM originally recorded here was not. This comment
# claimed an async child (`cmd &`) INHERITS the EXIT trap while `( )` and `$( )`
# reset it. Re-measured 2026-07 on bash 5.2.37, nothing tested inherits it: not a
# backgrounded function (returning, exiting, or failing its `exec` — the radvd stub's
# exact shape), not a backgrounded subshell, builtin or external, and not a plain
# subshell, command substitution, or pipeline segment. So the construct that actually
# reached the handler is unconfirmed, and a reader should not build on the old model.
# The guard stays because its contract holds regardless of which construct triggers
# it, and harness_test.sh now pins that contract directly by invoking this handler
# from a differing BASHPID rather than by trying to reproduce the trigger.
#
# The owner is recorded as ${BASHPID:-$$}, not $$: inside a `( ... )` subshell $$ is
# still the OUTER shell's pid, so a suite that sources this file inside a subshell
# would install the trap while recording a pid that is not its own — and then the
# handler's own guard would disable it in the very process that installed it. Both
# duties silently stopped: the forgot-report guard never fired and $WORK leaked
# (measured 2026-07 with `bash -c '( . lib.sh; new_workdir; ok x )'`, which exited 0
# with the scratch dir still on disk). BASHPID needs bash >= 4.0; on an older bash the
# `:-$$` fallback degrades to the original behaviour rather than erroring, which is the
# right trade here (the CI runners and every dev box in the fleet are bash 5).

# provoked as root, and asserting it anyway fails for a maintainer running as root
# while passing on the non-root CI runner -- a per-user false failure, which is

#
# The body's end is found by scanning for a line that is exactly `}` or `)` in
# column 0, which shfmt -i 2 -ci -bn guarantees and the repo's own format gate
# enforces -- so a reformat that broke this would fail CI on the shipped file, not
# silently here. Both closers matter: a SUBSHELL-bodied function (`fn() (`, which
# entrypoint.sh uses for install_kiro_cli so its cd and traps cannot leak) closes
# with `)`, and a `}`-only scan runs straight past it into whatever follows. That
# over-capture is silent, because the result still parses and still defines the
# function asked for -- it just also redefines the next one or two, which is how a
# test starts asserting against something it never named.
#
# A one-line definition (`fn() { cmd; }`) is closed by its own opening line, so it
# is emitted alone rather than swept forward to the next function's closing brace.
#
# A miss is fatal rather than an empty source: a test that sources nothing would
# report every assertion as passing against a function that never ran. Reach that
# fatal through load_function, or by checking the status -- see its comment.
