# secure_tools_dir(): tighten what we can, and never brick boot over a tree the
# entrypoint does not own.
#
# The third argument encodes the app's failure posture. owned=1 is for the NINE directories the entrypoint
# creates itself — /config, $TOOLS, $TOOLS/bin, $TOOLS/opt, $TOOLS/npm,
# $TOOLS/npm/bin, $TOOLS/python, $TOOLS/python/bin and $TOOLS/kiro-cli-versions,
# which is exactly the make_config_dir list outside $HOME. Two properties put a
# directory in that set and both are needed: the entrypoint CREATES it, so a
# symlink or a plain file there is unambiguously anomalous rather than the
# operator's shape, and a reinstall REPAIRS its contents (the toolbelt engine
# reinstalls a tool it finds missing, the kiro-cli manager reinstalls from the
# pinned archive), so refusing to boot costs a download rather than data.
#
# The npm and python roots are in that set for the same reason $TOOLS/bin is:
# $TOOLS/bin leads PATH and its entries are symlinks INTO opt/, npm/bin/ and
# python/bin/, so root executes what those trees hold — and no leaf-file chmod
# stops a foreign host user who can write the ROOT from replacing a launcher.
#
# owned=0 is for $TOOLS/go and $TOOLS/go/bin, i.e. GOPATH/bin and its parent: on
# PATH but never created and never repaired here, and holding no integrity-gated
# binary (a `go install` lands whatever the operator asked for). This is a dev box
# whose operator reshapes /config on purpose, and `fatal` sleeps 10s and exits, so
# a boot that aborts on operator-owned state leaves no way in to fix it.
#
# Two halves below, and the second is not optional. The BEHAVIOURAL half drives the
# extracted function against temp dirs, one owned value at a time. The CALL-SITE
# half reads the shipped boot path and pins WHICH directory gets which value —
# nothing about the function's own behaviour can see that, so without it, flipping
# a fail-closed root to warn-only is a silent one-token edit.
#
# Lint directives for this whole file, each against a stated guarantee rather than
# an assumption:
#   SC2015 - the assertion form `[ cond ] && ok "..." || no "..."` cannot mis-fire,
#     because lib.sh's ok/no return 0 unconditionally by design (see their comment).
#   SC2016 - the call-site expectations below must stay single-quoted: they compare
#     the LITERAL text of the shipped script ($TOOLS as written, unexpanded).
#   SC2329 - the stat/chmod stubs below are invoked INDIRECTLY, by the extracted
#     function they shadow, which shellcheck cannot see.
