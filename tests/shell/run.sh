# This file is repo-owned; lib.sh and harness_test.sh beside it are synced from
# cplieger/ci and must not be hand-edited here.
#
# Covers what tests/image-smoke.sh cannot reach: entrypoint.sh's fail-CLOSED
# branches (a non-private /config, an unowned PATH segment that resists
# hardening) that a healthy boot never takes, plus the warn-only diagnoses that
# need a filesystem CI does not provide (a tools tree mounted noexec). The
# kiro-cli INSTALL itself is out of scope — the cplieger/pinstall library owns
# it and carries its own Go tests.
#
# Each *_test.sh runs as a separate process so one test's stubs/traps/shell
# options cannot leak into another's; all run even after an early failure.
