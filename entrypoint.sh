# kiro-cli is pinned via Renovate against the public install manifest at
# https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.json. Bumping
# the version literal triggers a reinstall on next container start (see
# the version-drift check below). Auto-update inside the binary is
# disabled so what runs always matches the version baked into the image
# tag. KIRO_CLI_SHA256 (x86_64) and KIRO_CLI_SHA256_ARM64 (aarch64) are
# the per-arch sha256 of the headless zip, BOTH enforced at install; the
# kiro-cli packageRule in cplieger/.github groups all three literals into
# one Renovate PR so neither arch's gate can land stale.
# COUPLING (re-verify on every bump): routes.go's status classifier matches
# kiro-cli's EXACT OSC 9 notification strings "Response complete" (turn end ->
# done dot) and "Permission required" (tool approval -> needs-input dot),
# verified against this version. A bump that reworded either string silently
# stops the per-tab status dots from latching (no error; only a Debug log in
# routes.go). The feature also depends on the chat.enableNotifications +
# chat.notificationMethod=osc9 settings set below and web-terminal-engine's
# WithKeepUnfocused() in routes.go -- keep all four in lockstep.
