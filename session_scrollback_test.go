// This file pins what this app decides about retained-history depth, which after
// 2026-08 is deliberately NOTHING: the session factory omits
// terminal.WithScrollbackCapacity so the engine's own default applies, and an
// operator overrides it per deployment through the env var the ENGINE names.
//
// It used to pin a literal wired into registerRoutes (5000, then 20000). That was
// the wrong thing to guard: the depth is a sizing decision shared by this app,
// web-terminal-server and vibekit, so a number here made it three numbers that
// drift, and the test only asserted that someone had typed the same digits twice.
// What is worth guarding is the PLUMBING — that the app adds no opinion of its
// own, that the shared variable actually reaches the ring, and that the one
// adjustment made to an operator's number is the engine's rather than a local
// copy of the threshold.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THESE ASSERTIONS IS LOAD-BEARING. An early version of the literal
// test was VACUOUS: it emitted 2500 lines and asserted oldest == 0, so ANY
// capacity above ~2500 passed. So each case emits PAST the capacity it expects,
// making eviction observable, and asserts committed-oldest EXACTLY. Red-check any
// change by editing the factory and confirming the failure.

// retainedLines drives the production session factory with the given deps,
// emits `emitted` lines, and returns the retention the ring settled on
// (committed - oldest) once enough lines have been committed to make eviction
// observable.

// TestResolveScrollback pins the operator-facing read of the shared

// LOG_LEVEL, LOG_OSC_TEXT and TOOL_CATALOG_REFRESH are all read
// by-name-only because a compose expansion mistake can put a credential on any
// key (CWE-532), and the last two each carry a test saying so. Four properties:
//
//   - absent and blank fall through to the engine default, and do so SILENTLY: a
//     warning on the path every deployment that never set the knob takes is a
//     line on every boot forever;
//   - a malformed value falls through with exactly ONE Warn, which names the key
//     and carries no copy of the raw value in its message or in any attribute;
//   - a value the ENGINE clamps keeps the engine's own warning, which does quote
//     the number — deliberately, because it already parsed as an integer and so
//     cannot be the secret this rule protects;
//   - the returned depth is the engine's verdict, never a local copy of the
//     threshold.
//
// Serial: capture.Default mutates the process-global default logger, and
// t.Setenv forbids t.Parallel anyway.
