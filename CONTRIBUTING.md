# Contributing to Web Terminal for Kiro

Web Terminal for Kiro is a single Go binary that serves a static web UI and brokers one
`kiro-cli chat` PTY per session (each browser tab is a session with its own
`/ws?session=` connection), via `terminal.NewSessionManager`. There is no chat-history store
and no ACP layer; the browser drives kiro-cli's own TUI through a terminal
stream. This guide covers the things the codebase won't tell you at a glance.

## Architecture at a glance

- `main.go`, `routes.go`: server entry point and route wiring (both at repo
  root, `package main`). `main.go` embeds the web UI with `//go:embed static`
  and assembles the middleware stack in `buildHandler` on top of `webhttp`
  (access logging, panic recovery, security headers, cross-origin protection).
- The kiro-cli install is the external
  [`cplieger/pinstall`](https://github.com/cplieger/pinstall) library, and it is
  the only installer. `startKiroCLI` (main.go) builds a `pinstall.Manager` from
  `kiroInstallConfig` (this app's deployment of the shared
  `pinstall/kirocli` release profile, fed by the pins `entrypoint.sh` exports)
  and runs it in the background after the listener binds, the same bind-first
  shape `startTools` uses. The library owns the download and its SHA-256
  verification, the version-addressed layout under
  `/config/tools/kiro-cli-versions/<version>/`, version selection, the per-boot
  assertion of the settings the app depends on, pruning, and the one-shot purge
  of the pre-2026-07 `/config/tools/bin` layout. What stays app-side is data and
  wording: the required set (`kiro-cli` plus the `kiro-cli-chat` sidecar), the
  four best-effort settings, the purge target list, the taint observation, the
  trusted-writer declaration, and `kiroReasonText`, which turns the library's
  typed `pinstall.Reason` into the four 503 reason strings an operator reads.
  The trusted-writer declaration is the one that can stop a boot: the library
  refuses to install into a tree another identity can write, and it reads
  access-control lists to find that out. This app declares NOTHING by default:
  `parseTrustedInstallUIDs` reads `TRUSTED_INSTALL_UIDS` and passes it to
  `TrustedUIDs`, so an unset variable (the shipped default) leaves the check
  fully enforcing. An operator whose volume the check refuses names the uid
  themselves, which is an assertion that the account is already at least as
  privileged as this server; a value baked into the image would make that
  assertion on behalf of every deployment that pulled it. Its verdict is what `/api/health`
  and the session-create gate read, its active version directory leads every
  session's `PATH`, and its `Rescan` backs the loopback
  `POST /api/kiro-cli/rescan` repair hook.
- `static-src/`: TypeScript + CSS sources, compiled into `static/`.
- Tool provisioning is the external
  [`cplieger/toolbelt`](https://github.com/cplieger/toolbelt) library, consumed
  headless: `startTools` (main.go) reconciles `/config/tools/tools.json` in the
  background after the listener binds, session creation waits on that first
  pass (503 "tools installing"), and `/api/tools` is the library's REST
  projection admitted for loopback socket peers only (`loopbackOnly` in
  routes.go). OS packages are the tools engine's too, as `apt:` manifest
  entries.

Web Terminal for Kiro is a thin consumer of the first-party web-terminal libraries: the
terminal engine `web-terminal-engine` (`github.com/cplieger/web-terminal-engine/v6`
server-side, `@cplieger/web-terminal-engine` client-side) and the reference UI
`@cplieger/web-terminal-ui`. Most of "what the terminal does" lives in those
repos, not here. The Go server and TS client share a binary wire protocol, not
code; a wire-format change is a `web-terminal-engine` concern and lands in that
repo, not this one.

Observability is slog-only: webhttp's `Logging` middleware (wired in
`buildHandler` with `WithClientIP()`) emits a structured access-log line per
request (method/path/status/duration_ms/request_id/client_ip), except on the
long-lived streams (`/ws`, `/api/sessions/events`), which are deliberately
skipped (the request id is still minted and echoed there); the `/api/health`
probe logs at Debug while healthy (out of the default info stream) and
surfaces at Warn/Error when the probe fails, via webhttp's `ProbeLogLevel`.
The session-token-bearing `/api/sessions/{id}` paths ARE
logged, with the recorded path rewritten to the token-free route template
(`/api/sessions/{id}`, `/api/sessions/{id}/title`) via webhttp's
`WithPathFunc`, so their telemetry survives without a live token ever
reaching log-read consumers. There is no
Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint. Log timestamps are UTC (`slogx`'s `UTCTime`
`ReplaceAttr` forces the record time to UTC), so the image needs no `TZ` and
embeds no `time/tzdata`.

## Generated assets (read before building)

`static/*.js` and `static/style.css` are build artifacts and are
git-ignored; the sources of truth are under `static-src/`. Regenerate them
before `go run .` or `go build .`, otherwise `go:embed` captures a stale or
empty tree:

```sh
go generate ./...   # runs: tsc --project static-src/tsconfig.json -> static/app.js
```

`go generate` runs the TypeScript 7 native compiler `tsc` from `static-src`'s
`@typescript/native` devDependency, so run `cd static-src && npm install` first
(the `//go:generate` directive invokes `static-src/node_modules/.bin/tsc`).
Web Terminal for Kiro ships no local CSS: the bundle is assembled from the vendored
`@cplieger/web-terminal-ui` package. At image-build time the Dockerfile
concatenates the files listed in that package's `css/MANIFEST` into
`static/style.css`. For a local `go run .`, install the package first
(`cd static-src && npm install`), then reproduce the bundle from the repo
root with the canonical script (skips blanks + `#`-comments, handles a
missing trailing newline, the same recipe the Dockerfile and
`scripts/dev-build.sh` run):

```sh
sh scripts/css-bundle.sh static-src/node_modules/@cplieger/web-terminal-ui/css static/style.css
```

## Local dev setup

Run the server directly once assets exist:

```sh
go generate ./...
WORK_DIR=/path/to/workdir go run .
```

`WORK_DIR` must point at an existing directory (the server exits if it is
missing) and `LISTEN_ADDR` defaults to `:9848`. A bare `go run` installs nothing:
with no pins in the environment the server resolves `kiro-cli` by bare name
through your own `PATH`, so the terminal works if you have one installed. In
production `entrypoint.sh` exports the Renovate-pinned version and both per-arch
digests, and the server installs from them.

### Exercising the managed install without a 528 MB download

No env var points the server at a binary you picked; the install manager is the
only thing that resolves kiro-cli's path. What the manager does do is adopt a
version directory that is already complete on disk, downloading nothing, and
that's the seam to use locally and in tests. Populate it yourself:

```text
$KIRO_CLI_TOOLS_DIR/kiro-cli-versions/<version>/
├── kiro-cli         # executable; must answer `--version` with <version>
├── kiro-cli-chat    # executable; required, chat over a PTY is the product
└── .complete        # the sentinel; written LAST, contains <version>
```

```sh
export KIRO_CLI_TOOLS_DIR=/tmp/kweb-tools KIRO_CLI_VERSION=2.14.2
# The RUNNING architecture's digest must be set and well-formed (64 lowercase
# hex characters); the install manager validates it at construction, before it
# knows whether anything will be downloaded. Nothing is fetched here, so the
# value is never compared against an archive and a placeholder is enough. The
# other architecture's digest may stay unset -- only the resolved GOARCH is
# validated. On an aarch64 host set KIRO_CLI_SHA256_ARM64 instead.
export KIRO_CLI_SHA256=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
V="$KIRO_CLI_TOOLS_DIR/kiro-cli-versions/$KIRO_CLI_VERSION"
mkdir -p "$V"
cp /path/to/kiro-cli /path/to/kiro-cli-chat "$V/"
printf '%s\n' "$KIRO_CLI_VERSION" >"$V/.complete"
WORK_DIR=/path/to/workdir go run .
```

Leaving both digest variables unset does NOT work, and fails in the least
obvious way: the manager refuses to construct (`amd64 digest: want 64 hex
characters, got 0`), so the server logs one error and then reports
`kiro-cli unavailable` forever, with every session refused, even though the
version directory on disk is complete and nothing was ever going to be
downloaded. `.complete` is what makes the directory a selection candidate, and
the two per-boot gates still run against whatever you put there: `kiro-cli
--version` must print the directory's own name, and `app.disableAutoupdates=true`
must be assertable through `kiro-cli settings` or readiness is withheld. A shell
script answering both is enough for a wiring check;
`kirocli_wiring_test.go` builds exactly that fake dispatcher set (and pins both
digest outcomes: a malformed pin reports unavailable, a well-formed one
activates).

`/api/health` reports readiness. Under a bare `go run` it reflects only that the
HTTP listener is up: with no pins there is no install to gate on, and the tools
engine is disabled when `/config` is missing (the container's persistent bind
mount, and not configurable); a warn is logged and the `/api/tools` routes are
absent. In the image it also reflects the install manager, so `/api/health` returns
`503 {"reason":"kiro-cli installing"}` while the first-boot download runs and a
different reason (`kiro-cli install retrying`, `kiro-cli unavailable`,
`kiro-cli required settings not enforced`) once something has gone wrong. The
container healthcheck reflects that, and the same verdict gates session creation
so a tab cannot spawn a terminal before there is a kiro-cli to run.

Frontend tooling lives in `static-src/`; run npm commands from there:

```sh
cd static-src
npm install
```

## Running checks

Go (from the repo root):

```sh
go test ./...           # unit + fuzz tests, co-located as *_test.go
golangci-lint run       # lint (config in .golangci.yaml)
golangci-lint fmt       # apply gofumpt + gci formatting
```

`golangci-lint run` reports unformatted files as issues, so the formatters
(`gofumpt` with extra rules, `gci`) are enforced, not just available.

`entrypoint.sh` has its own unit tests, which CI runs by this filename. Run them
after any change to the boot path; they extract the real functions and drive
them against temporary directories, so they need no container:

```sh
bash tests/shell/run.sh
```

Frontend (from `static-src/`):

```sh
npm run typecheck       # tsc -project tsconfig.json
npm run test            # vitest --run (headless Chromium + node; *.test.ts)
npm run lint:eslint     # eslint .
npm run lint:prettier   # prettier --check .
npm run lint:knip       # unused-export / dependency check
```

The unit suite runs in a REAL browser. Vitest is configured with two projects:
everything named `*.test.ts` runs in headless Chromium (Browser Mode), and the
`*.node.test.ts` suffix opts a file out into Node. There is no per-file
environment pragma to add — Browser Mode is a runner, not an environment.

Use the suffix only for a genuine Node capability. `app.node.test.ts` has it
because it recursively walks two dependency `src` trees inside `node_modules` and
TS-parses them, lists the served `../static` directory, and reads PNG header
bytes; none of those has a Vite-import equivalent. A DOM test that needs a served
asset imports it instead: `import indexHtml from "../static/index.html?raw"`,
which is resolved at transform time and therefore fails to build when the asset
is renamed. Tests must assert at least once (`expect.requireAssertions`) and
`.only` is forbidden.

The browser is installed once per machine with
`npx --no-install playwright install chromium`; CI installs it with
`--with-deps`.

Two things about the browser project that look like mistakes and are not: the
dynamic import in `app.test.ts` carries a `.ts` extension and a unique query
(the browser's module map is keyed by URL, so that is the only way to re-run
app.ts's top-level code per test, and the extension is what keeps v8 coverage
attributed to the real file), and `window.location.reload` cannot be spied on
because it is unforgeable in a real browser — the one test that needs it shadows
the `window` identifier for a single evaluation.

## Conventions and gotchas

- **Always use webhttp's response helpers.** Never hand-craft JSON error
  bodies (`http.Error` with a JSON string, `w.Write([]byte(...))`). Every
  app-owned ERROR response (4xx/5xx) is `webhttp.WriteError` with an empty
  code (the standard `{error, request_id}` envelope); the two 403 gates and
  the tools-installing 503 all speak it. `webhttp.WriteJSON` /
  `webhttp.WriteJSONStatus` / `webhttp.Ok` are for non-error documents only
  (`/api/health`'s `{status, reason, tools}` is a health-probe contract, not
  an error envelope). Routes mounted by the pinned engine answer in the
  engine's own plain-text dialect; that is an engine-repo concern, not a
  reason to fork the app-owned shape.
- **Client-local vs library code.** `static-src/app.ts` is the only client
  source Web Terminal for Kiro owns: a
  `createTerminal("#terminal", { features: presetAgentTabbed, theme })` call
  plus the `data-bootstrap-fatal` handoff check. The theme is Web Terminal for
  Kiro's purple
  token set, and `presetAgentTabbed` pulls in tabs, the activity monitor,
  touch toolbar, context menu, clipboard, scroll-to-bottom, predictive echo,
  connection banner, and animations. Startup failures (a missing `#terminal`
  root, a preset that throws, a kernel-init failure) are the library's since
  web-terminal-ui v5: `createTerminal` resolves the selector and calls the
  preset inside its own failure boundary and renders its recovery panel. The
  one app-owned startup decision left is aborting boot when `index.html`'s
  inline watchdog has already claimed the `#loading` overlay
  (`data-bootstrap-fatal`). The input model,
  IME/composition, predictive echo, viewport, mobile key toolbar, and status
  banner, plus the render / keyboard / scroll / connection layers, all live in
  `@cplieger/web-terminal-ui` (built on `@cplieger/web-terminal-engine`);
  don't reimplement them here.
- **CI workflows are synced, not editable.** Files under `.github/workflows/`
  carry a "Synced from cplieger/ci, DO NOT EDIT" header; the pipeline is
  centralised in `cplieger/ci`. Change behaviour there, not here.
- **kiro-cli install model.** `entrypoint.sh` declares `KIRO_CLI_VERSION` +
  both per-arch digests (Renovate-managed) and exports them; the `pinstall`
  manager `kiroInstallConfig` builds installs from them. Keep the pins as shell
  literals with their
  `# renovate:` anchors, where the custom datasource finds them. Don't switch to
  `latest/` URLs, bake the binary into the image, or re-enable in-binary
  auto-update; each breaks the pinned-sha / image-tag reproducibility story.
  Don't add a second installer to the entrypoint: one installer, in the server,
  is what makes the version-addressed layout and the readiness verdict agree.
  Don't drop `kiro-cli-chat` from `Config.Require`: the library requires only the
  primary artifact by itself, and `chat` over a PTY is this app's product, so a
  directory without the sidecar would count as a complete install and then kill
  every terminal at chat (vibekit's required set is deliberately smaller; don't
  copy either app's set into the other).
  `/config/tools/bin/kiro-cli` is a convenience symlink for
  `docker exec … kiro-cli`; nothing in the product reads it, so don't gate
  anything on it.
- **The image runs as root by design.** OpenSSH resolves `~` from the passwd
  entry, not `$HOME`, and the Dockerfile wires that entry for root
  (`/config/home`). Don't add a `user:` line to `compose.yaml` or the README
  run example: a non-root UID has no passwd entry, so `git`/`gh` over SSH
  fail with `No user exists for uid …`. Files under `/config` and `/workspace`
  are root-owned on the host as a result.
