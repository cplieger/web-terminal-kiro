// image's baked health probe (`curl -sfS --max-time 4`, no -L). Verified against
// the real mux on go1.26.5, every one of these was a 307 before the guard — and a
// 307 makes those callers exit 0 having never reached a handler, so the mutation
// silently did not happen.
//
// The assertion that matters is therefore twofold and both halves are checked:
// the response is a 4xx the caller cannot mistake for success, and it is NOT a
// redirect. Asserting only "not 307" would pass on a 200; asserting only "400"
// would pass if some future layer answered 400 for an unrelated reason.
//
// Driven through buildHandler — the REAL chain in production order — because the
// guard is chain middleware by necessity: ServeMux's canonicalization runs BEFORE
// pattern selection, so no wrapper at the mount (where loopbackOnly sits) can
// ever see one of these requests. A test against the mux alone would assert the
// old 307 and stay green forever.
