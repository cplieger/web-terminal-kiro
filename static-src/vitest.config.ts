// Vitest 4.1 configuration for web-terminal-kiro TypeScript unit tests.
//
// TWO projects, and the DEFAULT is the browser: a test file runs in real
// headless Chromium unless its name opts out. There is no `environment` and no
// per-file environment pragma any more — Browser Mode is a runner, not an
// environment, and it replaces the DOM emulator this suite used to load.
// The browser is where this app's markup actually runs, so a <link> really
// loads, sequential focus navigation really exists, and `disabled` is really
// reflected.
//
// The opt-out is the `.node.test.ts` suffix: reason in the stem, placement in
// the suffix. `app.node.test.ts` is the ONLY file that needs it, and it needs it
// for capabilities no Vite import can express — a recursive walk of two
// dependency `src` trees inside node_modules that TS-parses every file it finds,
// a served-directory listing, a runtime-derived file list, and PNG header bytes.
// Everything the browser half reads arrives as a `?raw` import instead, which is
// resolved at transform time and therefore fails to RESOLVE when an asset is
// renamed, where a filesystem read only threw once the test ran.
//
// The glob is `**/*.node.test.ts`, not `src/**/*.node.test.ts`: this package's
// tests sit at the package ROOT (there is no src/), and a src-anchored glob
// would match nothing, putting the node file in the browser project in silence.
// Verify per-project file counts in the run output after touching either glob.
//
// `extends: true` is load-bearing, not decoration: without it a project inherits
// NOTHING from the options below, so `expect.requireAssertions`, `allowOnly`,
// `mockReset`, `sequence` and the exclusions would all silently stop applying to
// both halves of the suite.
//
// `channel: "chromium"` opts into Chromium's newer headless mode, the real
// browser rather than the separate headless-shell build. CI installs it with
// `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`; locally it is a one-time
// `npx --no-install playwright install chromium`.
//
// Run: vitest --run (single pass) or vitest (watch mode)

// Vitest's defaults (node_modules at any depth, .git); spreading
// configDefaults.exclude avoids narrowing the built-in "**/node_modules/**" to a
// top-level-only glob.
// "**/.stryker-tmp/**" keeps a leftover Stryker sandbox (an interrupted mutation
// run does not clean it up) from double-collecting the suite's test files with
// stale or mutated copies.
// "**/*.e2e.test.ts" is Playwright's namespace (playwright.config.ts testMatch),
// not vitest's: a playwright spec imports @playwright/test, which fails at
// collection under vitest, so without this exclusion the unit gate goes red on a
// file it can never run.
// (Compiled output under ../static needs no entry: include/exclude resolve
// against this directory, so files outside it are never collected.)
