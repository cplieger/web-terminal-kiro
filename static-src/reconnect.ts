// Pure reconnect-delay scheduler for the vibecli WebSocket.
//
// Reconnect strategy: exponential backoff capped at MAX_DELAY_MS, with
// uniform random jitter in [0, JITTER_MS) added to each scheduled
// attempt. The per-attempt jitter prevents thundering-herd reconnects
// when several browser tabs lose connectivity together; the cap keeps
// the worst-case wait bounded so a long network outage doesn't push
// the next retry an hour out.
//
// Pulled into a dedicated module so the formula is testable without
// real timers: callers inject `random()` (typically `Math.random`)
// and receive both the delay to wait this attempt and the new base
// delay for the next attempt. This separates the math from the
// timer-side-effect plumbing in app.ts.
