// TestSessionFastDeathWarn pins the operator-facing fast-death signal wired in
// registerRoutes' session factory (WithOnProcessExit): a session whose process
// dies within seconds of spawn while the server is SERVING (ready=true) is the
// kiro-cli-missing/broken signature and must be promoted to exactly one Warn;
// an app-initiated teardown (readiness already cleared by the SIGTERM pre-drain
// or the Serve-error path) must stay quiet, or every deploy would emit a false
// broken-install alert. Neither branch was asserted anywhere: the hook's
// statements were executed only incidentally when unrelated tests' cleanups
// killed their live sessions, so deleting the Warn or inverting the ready gate
// would have passed the suite.
//
// Synchronization: the manager's session status derives from Handler.Exited(),
// whose procExitCh closes only AFTER the engine's process monitor has invoked
// the OnProcessExit callback (terminal.go: the callback runs in the monitor
// body, the channel close in its defer). Polling GET /api/sessions for a
// TERMINAL status is therefore a deterministic happens-after barrier for the
// Warn decision on BOTH branches — no bare sleep guessing.
//
// The barrier accepts EITHER terminal status, because which one the engine
// reports is not this test's subject. Engine v3.3.0 split session exit in two
// (refinedStatus reads Handler.exitOutcome): StatusCrashed for a non-zero
// status or an unrequested terminating signal, StatusExited narrowed to an
// ordinary end — status 0, or any exit the server itself caused. /bin/false
// exits 1 unprompted, so it lands on crashed, while a teardown-initiated Close
// of the same session lands on exited. Both mean the monitor ran, which is the
// only thing the barrier needs; classifying the exit is the engine's own test's
// job, not a consumer's. Matching only "exited" is what stalled the v3.2.1 ->
// v3.3.2 bump: all three rows burned their full deadline on a session already
// sitting at crashed.
//
// Serial: capture.Default mutates the process-global default logger, and the
// factory binds its session logger from slog.Default() at Create time (no
// t.Parallel).
